# Olympic-Medals-Predictor
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the number of medals a country will win in the Olympics using historical data. The project follows a structured seven-step approach to building a machine learning model using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

1. **Form a Hypothesis:** A statement that we can prove and disprove using data. This scenario our hypothesis is that we can predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics using data.
2. **Data Collection:** Use a dataset containing Olympic performance data.
3. **Data Reshaping:** Ensure the target and predictor variables are appropriately structured.
4. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing and incorrect values to prepare data for analysis.
5. **Error Metric:** Use Mean Absolute Error to evaluate model performance.
6. **Data Splitting:** Split data into training and testing sets to validate model accuracy.
7. **Model Training:** Implement linear regression using predictors like previous medals and athlete count
